In order to protect your account, certain dollar limits are automatically applied to your Scotiabank Interac Flash debit card for “tap” payments.  For individual transactions, the maximum purchase amount is set to $100.  If the amount is greater than $100 you will be asked to insert your card and enter your PIN.  A “global” maximum of $200 for consecutive Interac Flash transactions also applies.  Once that limit is reached, you will be asked to insert your card and enter your PIN; this will reset the global limit, allowing you to tap for purchases once again.
